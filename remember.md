We are using infura which is a service that allows you to use their ethereum node instead of creating our own locally this allows us to find information which is distributed on the ethereum network such as current transactions

We are using web3.py to interface with eth blockchain nodes in this case infura

we are using flask to build the dynamic web pages

we are using twitter's bootstrap as a style guide

we are using ccxt to recall eth information such as current price which isnt obtainable through web3.py
